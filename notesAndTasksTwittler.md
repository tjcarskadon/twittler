__Topic:__User filtering
- 

###Name filter tasks:
- [x] Make each name a link
- [ ] Click the link and then remove all users 
- [ ] create a loop that goes thru streams and prints only tweets from the selected user - Might just recursivly call the printTweets function to handle this.
- [ ] create a method for going back to all tweets






#Nice to haves:
- [ ] mode that lets you choose between auto display and clicking the button to display new tweets
- [ ] 


#Notes:
- tweets are in the streams object stored as arrays with all the data.
- Need to handle what happens if you click the button lots of times qucikly and no tweets are ready
- Might be a good idea to use classes as a flag for hiding and revelaing users when filtering.
